CLOTHES PRICE PREDICTION
Clothes price prediction is a type of model that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to accurately predict the prices of the clothing items

SCOPE OF THE PROJECT
We have made a software that can help companies predict the price of the clothes they are selling based on parameters. They can also analyze the data they have stored
to have a better inventory and stock management.This could help them make their buying process more efficient and thus prevent overstocking.This project could also 
motivate local or unorganized cloth business owners to take their inventory online so that they can take help of the benefits of this project.This can be useful in 
online clothing application and also can be used by an individual to determine a fair price.It can also help local retailers to set a reasonableprice for the product.
